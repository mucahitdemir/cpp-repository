 ### Modern C++ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and STL skills. C++14 and C++17 covered

C++ is extremely fast and is a general-purpose programming language that supports both procedure and object-oriented programming making it very flexible.
#include <iostream> is a header file library that lets us work with input and output objects, such as cout (used in line 5). 
Header files add functionality to C++ programs. Using namespace std means that we can use names for objects and variables from the standard library.
