C++ is extremely fast and is a general-purpose programming language that supports both procedure and object-oriented programming making it very flexible.
#include <iostream> is a header file library that lets us work with input and output objects, such as cout (used in line 5). 
Header files add functionality to C++ programs. Using namespace std means that we can use names for objects and variables from the standard library.

In C++, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:

**int** - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123

**double** - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99

**char** - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes

**string** - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes

**bool** - stores values with two states: true or false


## C++ Operators

**Constants**

When you do not want others (or yourself) to override existing variable values, use the const keyword (this will declare the variable as "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only):


**cin** is pronounced "see-in". Used for input, and uses the extraction operator (>>)
